# ✨ Window App v1.6.0: The Dark Mode Redesign
**Reliability & Aesthetics Overhaul**

This update brings a massive visual upgrade and critical stability improvements.

## 🎨 Design & Experience
*   **Premium Dark Mode:** Completely redesigned dark theme with OLED-friendly "True Black" backgrounds and high-contrast text. No more invisible text or washed-out cards.
*   **Glassmorphism UI:** Cards now feature a subtle, modern glass effect that adapts perfectly to both Light and Dark modes.
*   **Typography:** Enhanced font hierarchy with *Inter* for better readability.
*   **Visual Polish:** Improved empty states, smoother transitions, and consistent iconography.

## ⚡ Performance & Stability
*   **Deep Theme System:** Implemented a centralized theme engine. The app now intelligently switches styling tokens based on system preferences.
*   **Auto-Update Fixed:** Resolved the "Hidden Update" bug. This version restores the automatic update prompt functionality.
*   **Memory Optimization:** Reduced memory usage in list views.

## 🛠 Fixes
*   Fixed: Customer names invisible in Dark Mode.
*   Fixed: Search bar contrast issues.
*   Fixed: Manual Sync button visibility in Dark Mode.
*   Fixed: `SystemGuard` update check logic.

**Notes for Users:**
*   If you are on v1.5.2 or earlier, you **must manual update** to this version. Future updates will be automatic.
